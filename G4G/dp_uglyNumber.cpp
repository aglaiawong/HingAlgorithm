/* Ugly number@G4G: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ugly-numbers/
Find the nth Ugly number.
- i.e. define ugly number: Ugly numbers are numbers whose only prime factors are 2, 3 or 5.
- i.e. ensure no other prime factor. <-- how to achieve this? 
- check the result of division, if even, let it go;
  otherwise, i.e. if odd, recursively divide into base case and see if the result belongs to {2,3,5}
